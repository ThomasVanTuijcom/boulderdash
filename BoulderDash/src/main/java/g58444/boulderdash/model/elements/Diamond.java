 * A diamond is an element of the BoulderDash game. It is the collectable element by the player inside our game. The
 * diamond is subject to gravity, so if the diamond has place underneath him, he will fall or slide on a stone a fall
 * further on. This class is a subclass of the element abstract class.

     * The diamond can fall vertically, slide on a rock/diamond or kill the player if he can. The diamond has some
     * priorities, that means that the first move that he will add to the list if he can, is the move to kill a player.
     * This is very important because, if the diamond has more than one move available, when he will have to move later
     * on. It will always prefer to kill the player than move somewhere else. The next priority is the vertical move,
     * finishing by the side moves with priority on the left side.
